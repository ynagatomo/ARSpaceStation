This is a minimal AR iOS app that shows the International Space Station (ISS) in real scale.

- Xcode 13.2.1
- Target: iOS / iPadOS 14.0+

Warnning: The project includes heavy 3d assets like a USDZ file of 80MB.

The ISS 3d data was delivered by NASA. Thank you for sharing great 3d model resources.
